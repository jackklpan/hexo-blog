when upgrade to xcode8, you may encounter some error in react native.

[This link](http://bbs.reactnative.cn/topic/2595/react-native-0-32%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8B%E7%89%88%E6%9C%ACxcode8%E6%8A%A5%E9%94%99%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E5%8A%9E%E6%B3%95/2)'s method can fix in iOS 10. However, will be crach in iOS 8.4.

Finally, I use the method in [this link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7c8b91442b3547cf94c752f234210bef0848c00a).
